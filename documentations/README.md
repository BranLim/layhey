## What is Layhey?

Layhey is a simple-to-use personal budgeting app that put focus on the flow of money. At one glance, we will be able to tell if we are having a surplus or deficit for a given week, month or year without all the noise.&#x20;

The idea was born due to frustration with Excel and other budgeting apps to track finances. With Excel and other budgeting app, it requires quite a fair amount of work to be able to organise transactions and calculate the in/out flow of money and whether there is a deficit or surplus for a given month, year or a period spanning a few years.
